                that makes people happy. Food is such an integral part of a
                gathering and good food enhances the experience. Our chefs have had the privilege to
                be part of all kinds of gatherings, from Weddings and
                Anniversaries’ to reunions and important corporate events.

                We have spent a lot of time sourcing produce that are
                interesting and artisan. Hand dived scallops from the west
                coast? You can have them. How about hand grown organic veggies?
                We can get those too! Are you a lover of small dairy artisan
                cheeses? We know a guy!
              </p>

                One used to provide tech support; the other used to prepare gourmet wieners and serve exotic yogurt. It just seemed to fit together.

                During our time on earth, we experience a series of trials that transformed who we were and how we viewed the world. At every step in our journey, we had family and friends at our sides who supported us and kept us grounded. At the end of the day, we would leave our worries at the door and gather together for dinner. All the joy, happiness, and comradery shared at the dinner table amongst family and friends are the reasons why we created Seadside Catering.  
              </p>
              <p class="card__para-normal">
                We wanted to recreate that experience for our clients, and what better way than through Seaside Catering.
